## Why We Started Fast Track

Behind every successful entrepreneur are brilliant mentors who coached, opened doors and paved the way, often before anyone else believed. But it’s not easy to find a good mentor and build an impactful relationship, especially in the fast-moving startup world. Fast Track was designed to connect accomplished leaders looking to work side-by-side and share their hard-won wisdom with the next generation. Since launching in 2016, we’ve helped over 1,500 pairs forge impactful bonds through structured 1:1 discussions and a larger community experience.

## How it works

At its core, Fast Track is a 90-day mentorship experience that pairs hundreds of tech leaders to mentor founders and high-potential operators (those at First Round-backed companies, and Black and Latinx folks at non-First Round backed startups). Mentees go through our powerful matching process to maximize the Mentor’s impact. Once matched, mentorship pairs meet virtually every two weeks with Mentors guiding their Mentees through the challenges of startup life, how to bolster their leadership skills, and grow their companies. In addition to these 1:1 meetings, we host virtual professional development workshops, curated learning sessions, and more personalized community experiences.
